                        &emsp; I know I have made mistakes. Sometimes, I am too shy to say things I should tell you. My job has also taken more time than I want, giving you less time than you deserve. But even with all of this, you are still here with me, showing me patience and understanding. I do not have enough words to thank you for staying by my side.

I admire how kind you are, always helping others without expecting anything in return. I love how much you care about animals, especially cats, dogs, and birds. I also admire how hard you study and how much you want to learn new things.

                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Even with my mistakes, I want you to know how grateful I am for you, for who you are, and for accepting me as I am. Maybe I do not always say it, but I really feel it. Every day, I try to be better for you. Thank you for being you, for being amazing. I am here for you whenever you need me.
                    </span>
